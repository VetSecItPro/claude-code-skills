# Claude Code Skills Library

**23 production-tested Claude Code skills** built from shipping real products at [Steel Motion LLC](https://steelmotionllc.com). All free, all open source.

A complete SDLC automation framework: plan, build, design, test, secure, and ship. Each skill is a structured prompt with execution phases, tool permissions, and built-in standards.

> **Disclaimer:** These skills are provided as-is under the MIT License. While they have been tested in production environments, they execute automated actions on your codebase (file edits, git operations, dependency changes, and more). Always review skill behavior in a safe environment before running on production code. Steel Motion LLC assumes no responsibility for unintended changes, data loss, or other issues resulting from the use of these skills. Use at your own discretion.

## Quick Install

Run this in your terminal (outside of Claude Code, in a standard shell session):

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VetSecItPro/claude-code-skills/main/install.sh)
```

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VetSecItPro/claude-code-skills.git
cp -r claude-code-skills/.claude/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r claude-code-skills/.claude/standards/* ~/.claude/standards/
```

After install, restart Claude Code. Skills appear as `/skill-name` commands.

> The installer is additive. If you already have skills in `~/.claude/commands/`, it merges without removing your existing ones.

## 4 Shared Standards

Every skill follows the same protocols for consistent behavior:

| Protocol | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `STATUS_UPDATES.md` | Standardized progress reporting: phase tracking, completion %, structured output |
| `CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md` | How skills read and preserve context: memory, file discovery, state |
| `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md` | Multi-agent coordination: delegation, parallel execution, result aggregation |
| `CLEANUP_PROTOCOL.md` | Resource cleanup — browser instances, dev servers, temp files, git stashes cleaned on exit |

---

## How It Works

Claude Code skills are Markdown files that define structured prompts, execution phases, and tool permissions. When placed in `~/.claude/commands/`, they become available as `/command-name` in any Claude Code session.

The standards protocols in `~/.claude/standards/` are automatically loaded into every session, ensuring consistent behavior across all skills.
